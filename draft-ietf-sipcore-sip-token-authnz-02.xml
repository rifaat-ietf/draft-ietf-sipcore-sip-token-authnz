    <t>
      The SIP protocol <xref target="RFC3261"/> uses the framework used by the HTTP
      protocol for authenticating users, which is a simple challenge-
      response authentication mechanism that allows a server to challenge a
      client request and allows a client to provide authentication
      information in response to that challenge.
    </t>

    <t>
      OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749" /> defines a token based authorization
      framework to allow clients to access resources on behalf of their user.
    </t>

    <t>
      The OpenID Connect 1.0 <xref target="OPENID" /> specifications defines
      a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which enables
      clients to verify the identity of the user based on the authentication
      performed by a dedicated authorization server, as well as to obtain basic 
      profile information about the user.
    </t>

     This document defines an mechanism for SIP, that is based on the OAuth 2.0

        In step [00], the UA collects the user's credentials with the AS.
      </t>

      <t>
        In steps [01] and [02], the UA first contacts the Authorization Server to 
        authenticate the user and obtain tokens to be used to get access to the 
        SIP network. 
      </t>
      <t>
        The tokens returned to the UA depend on the type of server: 
        with an OAuth Authorization Server, the tokens provided are the access 
        token and refresh token. With an OpenID Connect server, an additional
        ID-Token is returned, which contains the SIP URI of the user.

      <t>
        In step [03], the UA starts the registration process with the SIP registrar 
        by sending a REGISTER request with the access token it obtained previously.
      </t>

      <t>
        The registrar validates the access token, and if the access token provided 
        by the UA is an opaque token, then the registrar MAY perform an introspection, 
        steps [04] and [05], to obtain more information about the token and its 
        scope, as per <xref target="RFC7662"/>. Otherwise, after the registrar validates the token 
        to make sure it was signed by a trusted entity, it inspects its claims 
        and act upon it.
      </t>

      <t>
        When the registrar is satisfied with the token, it then replies with the 200 OK

        In step [07] the UA starts the registration process by sending a 
        SIP REGISTER request to the registrar without any credentials. The 
        REGISTER request includes an indication that the UA supports token-based
        autentication in the form of sip.token media feature tag.
        The registrar then challenges the UA, in step [08], by

  The scope and error parameters are defined in <xref target="RFC6749"/>.

  <t>
  The scope parameter could be used by the registrar/proxy to indicate to the UAC 
  the minimum scope that must be associated with the access token to be able to get 
  service. As defined in <xref target="RFC6749"/>, the value of the scope parameter 
  is expressed as a list of space-delimited, case-sensitive strings. The strings are 
  defined by the authorization server. The values of the scope parameter is out of 
  scope for this document.
  </t>

  <t>
  The error parameter could be used by the registrar/proxy to indicate to the UAC 
  the reason for the error, with possible values of "invalid_token" or "invalid_scope".

    The sip.token media feature tag, when inserted in the Contact header field
    of a SIP REGISTER request, conveys that the SIP UA associated with the tag
    supports a token based authentication mechanism, where the user authentication
    and SIP registration authorization is performed by a third party. The media 
    feature tag has no values.

      The security considerations for OAuth are defined in <xref target="RFC6749"/>.
      The security considerations for bearer tokens are defined in <xref target="RFC6750"/>.
      The security considerations for  JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are defined in <xref target="RFC7519"/>.
      These security considerations also apply to SIP usage of access token as defined in this
      document.
    </t>
    <t>
      <xref target="RFC6749"/> mandates that Access Tokens are protected with TLS. However, TLS only guarantees
      hop-to-hop protection when used to protect SIP signaling. Therefore the Access Token MUST be protected in
      a way so that only authorized SIP endpoints will have access to it. Endpoints that support this specifications
      MUST support encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> for encoding and protecting Access Token when
      included in SIP requests, unless some other mechanism is used to guarantee that only authorized SIP endpoints
      have access to the Access Token.

   This section defines a new media feature tag that extends the "SIP

   "Media Feature Tags" registry (https://www.iana.org/assignments/

    Media feature tag name: sip.token
    
    Summary of the media feature indicated by this feature tag: This 
        media feature tag, when inserted in the Contact header field
        of a SIP REGISTER request, conveys that the SIP UA associated 
        with the tag supports a token based authentication mechanism,
        where the user authentication and SIP registration authorization 
        is performed by a third party.

     Values appropriate for use with this feature tag: none

     Related standards or documents: RFC XXXX

     Security considerations: This media feature tag does not introduce
        new security considerations, as it simply indicates support for
        a basic SIP feature. However, if an attacker manages to remove
        the media feature tag from a SIP REGISTER request, the SIP UA
        that inserted it might not be able to authenticate itself with
        the SIP registrar to which the SIP request is addressed, as the
        SIP registrar might not be aware that the SIP UA supports the 
        feature associated with the media feature tag.
