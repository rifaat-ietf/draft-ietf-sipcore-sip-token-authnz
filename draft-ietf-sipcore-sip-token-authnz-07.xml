      <t>
      The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) <xref target="RFC3261"/> uses the framework
      used by HTTP <xref target="RFC7230"/> for authenticating users, which is a simple
      challenge-response authentication mechanism that allows a server to challenge a
      client request and allows a client to provide authentication
      information in response to that challenge.
      </t>
      <t>
      OAuth 2.0 <xref target="RFC6749"/> defines a token based authorization
      framework to allow clients to access resources on behalf of their user.
      </t>
      <t>
      The OpenID Connect 1.0 <xref target="OPENID"/> specifications defines
      a simple identity layer on top of the OAuth 2.0 protocol, which enables
      clients to verify the identity of the user based on the authentication
      performed by a dedicated authorization server, as well as to obtain basic 
      profile information about the user.
      </t>
      <t>
      This document updates <xref target="RFC3261"/>, by defining the UAC procedures if it 
      receives a 401/407 response with multiple WWW-Authenticate/Proxy-Authenticate 
      header fields, providing challenges using different authentication schemes 
      for the same realm.
      </t>
      <t>
     This document defines an mechanism for SIP, that relies on the OAuth 2.0 
     and OpenID Connect Core 1.0 specifications, to enable the delegation of the 
     user authentication and SIP registration authorization to a dedicated 
     third-party entity that is separate from the SIP network elements that 
     provide the SIP service.

  <section anchor="sec.sip">
      <name>SIP Procedures</name>
      <t>
      Section 22 of <xref target="RFC3261"/> defines the SIP procedures for the 
      Digest authentication mechanism procedures. The same procedures apply to 
      the Bearer authentication mechanism, with the changes described in this section.
      </t>
      <t>   </t>
      <section anchor="sec.sip.uac">
        <name>UAC Behavior</name>
        <t>   </t>
        <section anchor="sec.sip.uac.obtain">
          <name>Obtaining Tokens</name>
          <t>
          When a UAC sends a request without credentials (or with credentials that 
          are no longer valid), and receives a 401 (Unauthorized) or a 407 (Proxy 
          Authentication Required) response that contains a WWW-Authenticate header 
          field (in case of a 401 response) or a Proxy-Authenticate header field
          (in case of a 407 response) that indicates "Bearer" scheme authentication 
          and contains an address to an Authorization Server, the UAC contacts the 
          Authorization Server in order to obtain tokens, and includes the requested 
          scopes, based on a local configuration. 
          </t>
          <t>
          The tokens returned to 
          the UA depend on the type of AS: with an OAuth AS, the tokens provided 
          are the access token and refresh token. The access token will be sent to the
          SIP servers to authorize UAC's access to the service. The refresh token will 
          only be used with the AS to get new access token and refresh token, before 
          the expiry of the current access token. With an OpenID Connect server, an 
          additional ID-Token is returned, which contains the SIP URI and other user 
          specific details, and will be consumed by the UAC.
          </t>
          <t>
            The detailed OAuth2 procedure to authenticate the user and obtain
            these tokens is out of scope of this document. <xref target="RFC8252"/> defines
            procedures for native applications. When using the mechanism defined
            in <xref target="RFC8252"/> the user will be directed to use a browser for the interaction
            with the authorization server, allowing the authorization server
            to prompt the user for multi-factor authentication, redirect the user to
            third-party identity providers, and the use of single-sign-on sessions.
          </t>
          <t>
        If the UAC receives a 401/407 response with multiple WWW-Authenticate/Proxy-Authenticate 
        header fields, providing challenges using different authentication schemes 
        for the same realm, the UAC provides credentials for one or more of the schemes 
        that it supports, based on local policy.
          </t>
          <t>
          NOTE: The address of the Authorization Server might be known to the UAC 
          e.g., using means of configuration, in which case the UAC can contact 
          the Authorization Server in order to obtain the access token before it
          sends SIP request without credentials.

          <name>Protecting the Access Token</name>
          <t>
          <xref target="RFC6749"/> mandates that Access Tokens are protected with 
          TLS when in transit. However, TLS only guarantees hop-to-hop protection 
          when used to protect SIP signaling. Therefore the Access Token MUST be 
          protected in a way so that only authorized SIP servers will have access 
          to it. Endpoints that support this specification MUST support encrypted 
          JSON Web Tokens (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> for encoding and protecting 
          Access Token when included in SIP requests, unless some other mechanism 
          is used to guarantee that only authorized SIP endpoints have access to 
          the Access Token.

        specified in section <xref target="sec.sip.uac.obtain"/>
          </t>
          <t>
        When the UAC sends a REGISTER request after it received a challenge
        containing the Bearer scheme, then to resolve that particular challenge
        it needs to send a request with an Authorization header field containing
        the response to that challenge, including the Bearer scheme carrying a valid 
        access token in the request, as specified in <xref target="RFC6750"/>.
          </t>
          <t>
        Note that if there were multiple challenges with different schemes then it maybe 
        able to successfully retry the request using non-Bearer credentials.
          </t>
          <t>
        Based on local policy, the UAC MAY include an access token that has
        been used for another binding associated with the same AOR in the
        request.
          </t>
          <t>
        If the access token included in a REGISTER request is not accepted,
        and the UAC receives a 401 response or a 407 response, the UAC
        follows the procedures in Section 2.1.1.

          When a UAC sends a request, after it received a challenge containing

          with a Bearer scheme, carrying a valid access token in the request, as specified
          in <xref target="RFC6750"/>. Based on local policy, the UAC MAY include 
          an access token that has been used for another dialog, or for another 
          stand-alone request, if the target of the new request is the same.

        <t>
        When a UAS or Registrar receives a request that fails to contain
        authorization credentials acceptable to it, it SHOULD challenge the
        request by sending a 401 (Unauthorized) response. To indicate that
        it is willing to accept an OAuth2 token as a credential the
        UAS/Registrar MUST include a Proxy-Authentication header field in the
        response, indicate "Bearer" scheme and include an address of an
        Authorization Server from which the originator can obtain an access token.
        </t>
        <t>
        When a UAS/Registrar receives a SIP request that contains an Authorization 
        header field with an access token, the UAS/Registrar MUST validate the access 
        token, using the procedures associated with the type of access token used, e.g. <xref target="RFC7519"/>.
        If the validation is successful the UAS/Registrar can continue to process 
        the request using normal SIP procedures. If the validation fails, the UAS/Registrar

      <name>Access Token Claims</name>
      <t>
    The type of services that an access token grants access to can be determined

    If an access token is encoded as a JWT, it might contain a list of claims 
    <xref target="RFC7519"/>, some registered and some are application specific claims. The 
    REGISTRAR can grant access to services either based on such claims, using 
    some other mechanism, or a combination of claims and some other mechanism.
    If an access token is a reference token, the REGISTRAR will grant access 
    based on some other mechanism. Examples of such other mechanisms are 
    introspection <xref target="RFC7662"/>, user profile lookups, etc.

  The authz-server parameters contains the HTTPS URI, as defined in

        <t> 
        In step [1], the UA starts the registration process by sending a 
        SIP REGISTER request to the registrar without any credentials. 
        </t>
        <t>
        In step [2], the registrar challenges the UA, by sending a SIP 
        401 (Unauthorized) response to the REGISTER request. In the response
        the registrar includes information about the AS to contact in order
        to obtain a token.
        </t>
        <t>
        In step [3], the UA interacts with the AS, potentially using the OAuth Native 
        App mechanism defined in <xref target="RFC8252"/>, authenticates the user and obtains the 
        tokens needed to access the SIP service.
        </t>
        <t>
        In step [4], the UA retries the registration process by sending a new
        SIP REGISTER request that includes the access token that the UA 
        obtrained previously.
        </t>
        <t>
        The registrar validates the access token. If the access token is a
        reference token, the registrar MAY perform an introspection,
        as in steps [5] and [6], in order to obtain more information
        about the access token and its scope, as per <xref target="RFC7662"/>. 
        Otherwise, after the registrar validates the token to make sure it was
        signed by a trusted entity, it inspects its claims and act upon it.
        </t>
        <t>
        In step [7], once the registrar has succesfully verified and accepted the 
        access token, it sends a 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request.

      <name>Security Considerations</name>
      <t>
      The security considerations for OAuth are defined in <xref target="RFC6749"/>.
      The security considerations for bearer tokens are defined in <xref target="RFC6750"/>.
      The security considerations for  JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are defined in <xref target="RFC7519"/>.
      These security considerations also apply to SIP usage of access token as defined in this
      document.
      </t>
      <t>
      <xref target="RFC6749"/> mandates that Access Tokens are protected with TLS. 
      However, TLS only guarantees hop-to-hop protection when used to protect SIP 
      signaling. Therefore the Access Token MUST be protected in a way so that 
      only authorized SIP endpoints will have access to it. Endpoints that support 
      this specifications MUST support encrypted JSON Web Tokens (JWT) <xref target="RFC7519"/> 
      for encoding and protecting Access Token when included in SIP requests, unless 
      some other mechanism is used to guarantee that only authorized SIP endpoints
      have access to the Access Token.
